# 5 Life Cycle Models

## 5.1 Card Life Cycle

### 5.1.1 Card Life Cycle States
<!-- Table 5-1: Card Life Cycle States -->
<!-- Figure 5-1: Card Life Cycle Diagram -->
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> OP_READY
  OP_READY --> INITIALIZED : personalize
  INITIALIZED --> SECURED : install keys
  SECURED --> LOCKED : lock
  LOCKED --> TERMINATED : terminate
5.1.2 Card Life Cycle State Transitions
Transitions require authenticated commands and privilege verification.
