# 3 Card Architecture

## 3.1 Security Domains
Security Domains (SDs) isolate keys and privileges.

<!-- Figure 3-1: Security Domain Relationships -->

  SD2 -->|Manages| AppB[App B]
<!-- Table 3-1: Typical SD Privileges --> <!-- presenter note: Explain delegation of application control from ISD to SDs. -->
3.2 Global Services Applications
Global services provide card-level utilities (CVM, registry access, lifecycle control).

3.3 Runtime Environment
Executes applets in isolation using a secure VM (e.g., Java Card). OPEN supervises dispatch and context switching.

3.4 Trusted Framework
Defines mechanisms for mutual trust and certification between domains.

3.5 GlobalPlatform Environment (OPEN)
OPEN manages card content, dispatching, and privilege verification.

3.6 GlobalPlatform API
Standardized interfaces for registry access, secure channels, and data sharing.

3.7 Card Content
Consists of Executable Load Files, Modules, and Applications.

3.8 Card Manager
Implements GlobalPlatform card commands (LOAD, INSTALL, DELETE, GET STATUS).

<!-- presenter note: Describe the Card Manager as the ISD logical interface. -->
